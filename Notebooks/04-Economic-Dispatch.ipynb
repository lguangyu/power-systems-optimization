    "We build up the model in several stages. We begin with a single-time period and simple generator constraints just related to allowable output ranges. This allows us to compare the model with the intuition provided by the merit order supply curve (also known as the \"dispatch stack\"). \n",

    "We then add multiple time periods by considering the economic dispatch over an entire day. Due to the simple generator constraints, this simple model does not introduce any coupling across time.\n",

    "## Introduction to economic dispatch\n",
    "\n",
    "Every day, system operators need to decide how to meet demand from a large variety of generators with different costs and engineering requirements. Prior to large-scale computational capabilities, this was accomplished by \"priority lists\" or similar heuristics to determine the ordering of plants. However, with modern optimization algorithms, operators can find the global minimum of production costs&mdash;and even incorporate coupling of engineering processes across time periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Economic dispatch** (ED) is the problem of minimizing short-run costs of production in order to meet a given demand, considering relevant engineering constraints of the generators. It *does not* fully capture the physics of electricity flows, which will further constrain the feasible space and which we will come back to in later notebooks on optimal power flow, nor does it account for decisions and constraints related to turning on or \"committing\" large thermal generators, which we'll discuss in our next notebook on unit commitment. Typically, *it does* incorporate some type of network representation, which we have ignored here by considering only a single bus. More on the networks in the notebook on optimal power flow."

Our optimal decision variables would not change by adjusting this constant up or down.\n",
