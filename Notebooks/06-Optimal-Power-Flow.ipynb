    "## Optimal Power Flow\n",
    "**Power Systems Optimization**\n",
    "\n",
    "by Michael R. Davidson, Jesse D. Jenkins and Sambuddha Chakrabarti (last updated: October 7, 2020)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides an introduction to the Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problem in electric power systems&mdash;which minimizes the short-run production costs of meeting electricity demand at a number of connected locations from a given set of generators subject to various technical and transmission network flow limit constraints. This will be our first treatment of a *network*, which is critical to all power systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will first introduce a model of transmission flows that assumes we can control the flow along each path, in what is called a \"**transport model**.\" This is a straightforward extension to [Economic Dispatch](04-Economic-Dispatch.ipynb) (ED), where we have multiple supply and demand balance constraints at each location or \"node\" in the network, and a new set of flow constraints between nodes. This is also similar to other common optimization problems such as fleet routing of shipments.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will then introduce a linear approximation to the optimal power flow problem known as \"**DC-OPF**\", where we begin to incorporate some of the physics involved in how electricity flows along transmission lines. With this formulation, we recognize that given \"injections\" (i.e., generation) and \"withdrawals\" (i.e., demand) of power at each node in the network, flows along lines are not independently controllable. Instead, electrical power flows across transmission lines in relation to their physical properties, namely power flows across parallel circuits or paths in inverse proportion to the [electrical impedance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_impedance) of the lines. This can (very frequently) result in hitting flow constraints before we would if could control power flows across all lines as in the transport problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook does not explore the full functionality of DC-OPF, which can include inter-temporal constraints, additional generation constraints (e.g., on voltage), security constraints to ensure stability in the case of contingencies, and network losses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Full \"AC optimal power flow\" models are also beyond the scope of this notebook, as the full set of physics associated with the interactions of AC flows introduces non-convexities that make this problem much harder to solve. Due to the non-convex nature of the AC power flow problem, simplified formulations that linearize and approximate these complex constraints are frequently employed in power systems operations, including by electricity system operators, which use a linearized \"security-constrained\" optimal power flow (which ensures power flows would remain simulatenously feasible across a range of possible contingencies) to clear real-time electricity markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start off with some simple systems, whose solutions can be worked out manually without resorting to any mathematical optimization model and software. But, eventually we will be solving larger system, thereby emphasizing the importance of such software and mathematical models."

    "## Introduction to OPF\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problem is a power system optimal scheduling problem which captures the physics of electricity flows across electricity networks, adding a layer of complexity and more realism to the Economic Dispatch (ED) problem. OPF usually attempts to capture the entire network topology by representing the transmission line interconnections between different nodes (also known as buses, or locations where generators or demand inject or withdraw power into/from the network) including various electrical parameters, such as resistance, series reactance, shunt admittance, etc. The full alternating current or \"AC\" OPF is a non-convex problem and turns out to be an extremely hard problem to solve (usually NP-hard). Hence, system operators and power marketers usually go about solving a linearized version of it, called the \"DC-OPF.\" The DC-OPF approximation works satisfactorily for bulk power transmission networks as long as such networks are not operated at the brink of instability or under heavily loaded conditions."

Inductive reactance causes the voltage waveform to shift forward relative to the current, while capacitive reactive cases the voltage to shift backwards relative to the current. In overhead transmission lines, the primary source of voltage phase angle shifts is the inductance of the transmission lines themselves (although capacitance is relevant for underground lines).\n",

In particular, the three basic assumptions used to derive a linearized or \"DC\" OPF approximation from the underlying AC OPF problem are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The resistance for each branch is negligible relative to the reactance, and can therefore be approximated as ~0.\n",
