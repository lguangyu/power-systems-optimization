    "Next, we discuss the impact of variable renewable energy sources (wind, solar) and present a slightly modified formulation that co-optimizes thermal and renewable capacities. \n",

    "Note these capacity expansion problems will be basic/simplified formulations, ignoring inter-temporal operating constraints (e.g. ramp limits), energy storage, network constraints and geospatial tradeoffs, unit commitment decisions for thermal generators, and operating reserves. We will define a more complex model integrating these factors in a future notebook after familiarizing ourselves with operational models (economic dispatch, unit commitment, and optimal power flow)."
