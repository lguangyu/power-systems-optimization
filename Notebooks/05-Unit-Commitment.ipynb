    "This notebook will build on the economic dispatch (ED) model by introducing binary startup (called \"commitment\") decisions, constraints, and costs of thermal generators. Similar to ED, it minimizes the short-run production costs of meeting electricity demand, but these additions are necessary for operating systems with large amounts of (inflexible) thermal generation. They also entail significant computational trade-offs.\n",
    "\n",
    "****\n",

    "We build up the model in several stages. We first start with the simplest model that incorporates unit commitment decisions in order to understand the logic of three-variable commitment formulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we introduce moderate complexity through the addition of ramp constraints&mdash;which we need to be modified from the ED to account for startups and shutdowns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we model a more realistic unit commitment that includes reserves&mdash;an important feature of day-ahead scheduling in power systems."

    "## Introduction to unit commitment\n",
    "\n",
    "Engineering considerations severely limit the possible output ranges of power plants. System operators need to be aware of these limitations when scheduling generation to meet demand. Thermal power plants, in particular, due to their complex designs, thermodynamic cycles, and material properties, can be particularly challenging. In practice, due to the times involved in bringing these power plants online, much of this scheduling is done day-ahead, which gives rise to the need for a day-ahead market.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Unit commitment** (UC) is the problem of minimizing short-run costs of production inclusive of production and startup costs, in order to meet a given demand and considering relevant engineering constraints of the generators. It is built on the ED model in that it typically considers all of the same variables in addition to the new startup-related variables and constraints&mdash;hence, it is also sometimes called unit commitment and economic dispatch (UCED). This notebook, for simplicity, only considers a single-bus case, while typical formulations usually include a simplified network representation."

    "We now add spinning reserve requirements to the model. Spinning reserves refer to generation capacity that is online and able to generate (e.g., within 10-30 minutes) if needed by the system operator. (Note: in Europe, these are referred to as tertiary reserves.) The SO will establish reserve requirements to maintain sufficient capacity to respond to demand or supply forecast errors or in case of \"contingencies,\" such as the unplanned and sudden loss of a generating station or a transmission line. The SO then typically operates a reserve market to competitively procure this available capacity. Most SO's actually define several classes of reserve products defined by their response time and period over which they may be activated. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will focus on spinning reserve requirements and establish a simple set of reserve requirements for reserves up (ability to quickly increase output) and reserves down (ability to quickly reduce output):\n",

    "The 5% of demand term in the constraints above is meant to provide sufficient reserves in either upwards or downwards direction to cover errors in the demand forecast. For simplicity, we ignore solar PV and wind production in our reserve calculation, though in practice, we would want to consider solar and wind forecast errors in calculating up reserve requirements as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our simple system, only thermal generators provide reserves. (This can be easily adjusted by changing the sets and defining the potential reserve contributions for different sets of resources differently, such as storage or hydro resources). The contribution of each generators to meeting reserves and the overall reserve constraint are thus given by:\n",

    "\n",
    "Note that in this case, we constrain the reserve contribution for each thermal generator to be the same as their hourly ramp rates, $RampUp_{g}, RampDown_{g}$. In practice, reserve products typically require a faster response time, on the order of 10-30 minutes for \"tertiary\" reserves (aka spinning reserves or contingency reserves), and 5-15 minutes for \"secondary\" reserves (regulation reserves). Thus, depending on the reserve requirements being modeled, one might specify a distinct maximum reserve contribution for each unit that reflects their ramping capabilities over shorter time periods."
